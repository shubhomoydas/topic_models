Following is the sequence of operations for pre-processing twitter data:

1. Basic preprocessing (removing special chars, separate handles/hashtags) and identify user communications

perl filter_tweets.pl

Input Files:
  - training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv
  - training-filtered-users.csv

Generated Files:
  - training-msgs.csv
  - training-user-references.csv

2. Figure out all user communities

perl explore_networks.pl

Input Files:
  - training-user-references.csv

Generated Files:
  - training-user-communications.csv
  - training-user-communication-counts.csv
  - training-user-groups.csv

3. Remove all stopwords from pre-processed tweets

perl remove_stopwords.pl

Input Files:
  - stopwords.txt
  - training-msgs.csv

Generated Files:
  - training-msgs-without-stopwords.csv

4. Get a subset of groups which have desired min size

perl filter_groups.pl

Notes:
  - The program output:
    total group records loaded: 175314

Input Files:
  - training-user-groups.csv

Generated Files:
  - training-filtered-groups.csv

5. Filter the twitter messages by the users to be retained according to filtered groups

perl filter_tweets_for_groups.pl

Notes:
  - Program output:
    total group records loaded: 333
    total user records loaded: 78590

Input Files:
  - training-filtered-groups.csv
  - training-msgs-without-stopwords.csv

Generated Files:
  - training-msgs-group-filtered.csv
  - training-msgs-user-counts.csv

6. Generate the vocabulary that assigns an integer index [0 - ...] to each word.

perl generate_vocab.pl

Notes:
  - Upon loading the set of messages, summary output:
    Loaded Vocab. Len=126689...
    
  - We filter out all words that have not appeared less than 60 times in the corpus
    We are then left with 4904 unique words in the vocabulary

Input Files:
  - training-msgs-group-filtered.csv

Generated Files:
  - vocab.csv

7. Prepare the feature vectors and apply the vocab filter

perl generate_feature_vectors.pl

Notes:
  - Following summary was output in last run:
    Total Docs: 437088, Total word count: 1371943, Avg words/doc: 3.1388255911853

Input Files:
  - vocab.csv
  - training-msgs-group-filtered.csv

Generated Files:
  - feature-vectors.csv
  - group-vector-counts.csv
  - user-vector-counts.csv
  - verify-user-vector-counts.csv

8. Analyze the number of connections in each group

perl analyze_groups.pl

Notes:
  - Following summary was output in last run:
    Total Docs: 437088, Total word count: 1371943, Avg words/doc: 3.1388255911853

Input Files:
  - training-user-communications.csv
  - training-filtered-groups.csv

Generated Files:
  - group-communication-counts.csv
